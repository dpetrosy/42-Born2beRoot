## ðŸ“œ About Project

> _The 42 project Born2beroot explores the fundamentals of system administration by inviting us to install and configure \
> a virtual machine. By the end of this project, we will have learned about virtualization, partitioning schemes, LVM, \
> command-line software, protocols such as SSH and the importance of securing a system thanks to sudo, firewalls \
> and password policies._

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](README_files/b2br_subject.pdf).

	ðŸš€ TLDR: This project consists of installing Debian on the VirtualBox and configuring it 
 		 according to the rules mentioned in the subject.
